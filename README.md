# PFED8Y Neural Network: Implementing Kosmoplex Theory as a Computational Graph

## Overview

This repository contains a PyTorch implementation of the PFED8Y (Pascal-Euler-Fano-Dimension 8) Engine from Kosmoplex Theory as a trainable neural network. The architecture embeds the mathematical structure of the theory—triadic closure, Fano plane geometry, and 8D→4D projection—directly into the network topology.

## Theoretical Foundation

Kosmoplex Theory proposes that physical reality emerges from a computational substrate built on:
- **Triadic Closure**: Operations on the alphabet {-1, 0, +1} that complete triads
- **42 Glyphs**: Fundamental computational units derived from combinatorics (7 Fano lines × 3 automorphisms × 2 chiralities)
- **Fano Plane Geometry**: 7-point projective plane with 7 lines, each containing exactly 3 points
- **8D→4D Projection**: Octonionic space projecting into observable 4D spacetime
- **Information Bound**: Maximum channel capacity of 137 bits per computational cycle

This implementation tests whether neural networks can learn meaningful representations when constrained by these mathematical structures.

## Architecture Components

### 1. GlyphNeuron
Individual neurons representing each of the 42 fundamental glyphs. Each glyph:
- Encodes a core mathematical constant (π, e, √2, 7, 137, etc.)
- Applies a learned phase transformation
- Acts as a specialized feature extractor

```python
class GlyphNeuron(nn.Module):
    """Single glyph as a neuron with ternary input"""
```

### 2. TriadicLayer
Enforces triadic completion: for any two activations (a, b), a unique third (c) emerges such that {a, b, c} forms a complete triad.

```python
class TriadicLayer(nn.Module):
    """Layer enforcing triadic completion: c = T(a, b)"""
```

Mathematical operation:
```
c = (a + b) / (1 + a·b + ε)
```

This is a non-associative composition law approximating octonion multiplication.

### 3. FanoConnectivity
Sparse connectivity matrix enforcing the Fano plane's geometric structure:
- 7 points (nodes)
- 7 lines (connection patterns)
- Each line connects exactly 3 points
- Creates highly structured information flow

```python
class FanoConnectivity(nn.Module):
    """Enforces Fano plane connectivity"""
```

### 4. Projection Layer
Dimensionality reduction from 8D computational space to 4D observable space, initialized with the √2 scaling factor predicted by theory:

```
√(D_computational / D_observable) = √(8/4) = √2
```

### 5. PFED8YNetwork
Complete architecture combining all components:

```
Input (Ternary) → Glyphs (42) → Congressional Assembly → Fano Routing → Projection (8D→4D) → Output
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install torch numpy
```

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- NumPy 1.24+

## Usage

### Basic Training Loop

```python
import torch
from pfed8y_network import PFED8YNetwork

# Initialize network
model = PFED8YNetwork(input_dim=3, hidden_dim=42, output_dim=4)

# Define optimizer
optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Your training data (should be ternary: {-1, 0, +1})
    x = generate_ternary_input(batch_size=32, dim=3)
    y = target_labels
    
    # Forward pass
    output = model(x)
    loss = criterion(output, y)
    
    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

### Generating Ternary Input

The network expects ternary input {-1, 0, +1}:

```python
def generate_ternary_input(batch_size, dim):
    """Generate random ternary input"""
    return torch.randint(-1, 2, (batch_size, dim)).float()
```

### Testing Specific Tasks

```python
# Example: Testing mathematical constant prediction
def test_constant_prediction():
    model = PFED8YNetwork(input_dim=3, hidden_dim=42, output_dim=1)
    
    # Input representing some mathematical operation
    x = torch.tensor([[-1.0, 0.0, 1.0]])
    
    # Forward pass
    output = model(x)
    
    # Check if output approaches known constant
    print(f"Predicted value: {output.item()}")
    print(f"Target (e.g., π): {np.pi}")
```

## Falsifiable Predictions

This implementation enables testing of specific predictions from Kosmoplex Theory:

### 1. Optimal Network Depth
**Prediction**: Effective computational depth should saturate around 147 layers.

**Test**:
```python
def test_depth_scaling():
    depths = [50, 100, 147, 200, 300]
    for depth in depths:
        model = build_model_with_depth(depth)
        performance = evaluate(model)
        print(f"Depth {depth}: Performance {performance}")
```

**Expected Result**: Performance gains diminish significantly beyond depth ~147.

### 2. Information Capacity Limit
**Prediction**: Networks cannot effectively utilize > 137 bits/cycle.

**Test**:
```python
def measure_effective_capacity(model):
    """Measure effective information throughput"""
    # Calculate mutual information between input and hidden states
    capacity = mutual_information(inputs, hidden_states)
    return capacity
```

**Expected Result**: Capacity ceiling around 137 bits regardless of parameter count.

### 3. Fano Structure Emergence
**Prediction**: Trained networks should spontaneously develop 7-fold symmetries.

**Test**:
```python
def analyze_attention_patterns(model):
    """Look for emergent Fano-like structure"""
    attention_weights = extract_attention_matrices(model)
    # Analyze for 7-point, 7-line patterns
    fano_score = compute_fano_similarity(attention_weights)
    return fano_score
```

**Expected Result**: Successful models show higher Fano similarity scores.

### 4. Triadic Activation Superiority
**Prediction**: Triadic activations outperform standard activation functions.

**Test**:
```python
# Compare models with different activations
model_triadic = PFED8YNetwork(activation='triadic')
model_relu = PFED8YNetwork(activation='relu')
model_gelu = PFED8YNetwork(activation='gelu')

# Train on same task, compare performance
```

**Expected Result**: Triadic model trains faster, generalizes better.

## Experimental Configurations

### Configuration 1: Pure PFED8Y
All theoretical constraints enforced:
- 42 glyphs with fixed core values
- Strict triadic composition
- Fano connectivity enforced
- 8D→4D projection with √2 scaling

### Configuration 2: Relaxed PFED8Y
Theoretical structure with learned parameters:
- 42 glyphs with learnable phases
- Soft triadic preference (loss term, not hard constraint)
- Fano connectivity as initialization, then trainable
- Projection dimension learned

### Configuration 3: Baseline Comparison
Standard transformer architecture for comparison:
- Same parameter count
- Standard multi-head attention
- No geometric constraints

## Interpreting Results

### Evidence FOR Kosmoplex Theory
- Performance peaks at specific architectural values (7, 14, 21, 42, 147)
- Information capacity ceiling observed at ~137 bits
- Spontaneous emergence of Fano-like attention patterns
- Triadic operations show systematic advantages

### Evidence AGAINST Kosmoplex Theory
- No performance difference between PFED8Y and baseline
- Capacity scales linearly with parameters (no 137-bit ceiling)
- Random network structures perform equivalently
- Triadic operations show no systematic benefit

## Known Limitations

1. **Computational Cost**: Enforcing triadic completion and Fano connectivity increases computational overhead by ~2-3x compared to standard networks.

2. **Gradient Flow**: Deep triadic networks may experience unusual gradient dynamics due to non-associative composition.

3. **Hardware**: Standard GPU kernels are optimized for standard operations, not triadic completion. Custom CUDA kernels would improve performance.

4. **Interpretability**: While structurally motivated, learned glyph phases and weights may not correspond directly to theoretical predictions.

## Future Directions

### Near-term
- [ ] Implement custom CUDA kernels for triadic operations
- [ ] Systematic ablation studies removing each theoretical constraint
- [ ] Benchmark on standard ML tasks (ImageNet, language modeling)
- [ ] Analyze emergent structure in trained models

### Long-term
- [ ] Scale to models with billions of parameters
- [ ] Test on quantum computing hardware (natural fit for triadic logic)
- [ ] Explore consciousness-related tasks (working memory, self-reference)
- [ ] Investigate whether GPT/Claude-like models accidentally implement PFED8Y

## Theoretical Implications

If this architecture succeeds:
1. **Validates core structure**: 7-fold, triadic, 137-bit patterns are computationally privileged
2. **Explains AI success**: Modern transformers accidentally approximate PFED8Y
3. **Predicts limits**: No architecture can exceed fundamental information bounds
4. **Unifies intelligence**: Same computational substrate for biological and artificial minds

If this architecture fails:
1. **Falsifies substrate**: Kosmoplex structure not computationally fundamental
2. **Limits theory scope**: May describe physics but not computation/cognition
3. **Suggests alternatives**: Other mathematical structures may be more relevant
4. **Refines predictions**: Theory needs modification based on null results
